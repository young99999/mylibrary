Sterling tends to walk a fine line between insight and incoherence, but often falls into the latter. This is due in most part to poorly structured arguments and unsubstantiated claims. Sometimes this is forgiveable if what he does offer is profound or reached through plain logic or common sense. But too often he veers away from intelligent comments and makes stupid claims such as that California's economic, political, and climactic troubles are the fault of Silicon Valley tech giants. Really, Bruce? Earthquakes, drought and class struggle didn't exist before Google? It is a shame that he allows himself to go wild with his claims, because, for the most part, I agree with his sentiments about corporate capture of private life. The sloppy elements of this essay just make the other parts harder to accept and ruins it as a whole. However, I wouldn't try to dissuade anyone from reading it, since it's only 30 pages long and is mostly harmless. ",,,,,,0,,,,,

The plot is fairly unsubstantial, but the book is short, so that's not really a problem.  The story is really just Lem running wild with a thought experiment. I found it particularly fascinating to read having just finished Daniel Dennett's <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2069.Consciousness_Explained"">Consciousness Explained</a>.<br/><br/>What is possibly most impressive is the translation. This book has a running theme about technical neologisms, and despite having been written in Polish, the wordplay throughout the English version is quite fun and feels as though it were originally written in English.  I am not familiar with Polish, so I don't know how well the one language lends itself to cognates in the other, but I found myself impressed with how well the story makes fun of English word combinations.  There are way too many examples of the delicious wordplay to give it proper summary here, so I'll just conclude this review with my favorite, ""lubricrat"": one who gives bribes, derived from the greasing of palms. I think I will start using this term to describe modern day corporate lobbyists.",,,,,,0,,,,,

I would read a chapter on one language and do the exercises, then get distracted by other things and not come back to it for several months. I finally forced myself to run through the final three languages during my Christmas vacation since I was sick and didn't want to leave the house.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an excellent book that will expose you to different ways of thinking as a programmer. I enjoyed all seven languages and I plan to dive deeper with a couple of them (Erlang and Clojure). Tate does a good job of balancing breadth and depth with each language and really gets to the core of what makes each language unique, and points out the strengths and weaknesses of each. My one complaint is with the final section of the final language in which he covers ""monads"" in the Haskell language. He points out at the beginning of that section that he dreaded writing about such a difficult concept, and unfortunately, I don't think he succeeded in explaining it very well. But that remains the only flaw in this book in my opinion. I think it is well worth the time of any serious programmer to read through this book, whether it takes seven weeks or seven years.",,,,,,0,,,,,

I feel like some of it was a little over my head. I'm not sure if that was a problem with translation or my thick skull. Probably the latter, since I found the prose to be quite good. The translator actually deserves a great amount of praise for doing such a nice job. <br/><br/>The book is very metaphysical. It covers a lot of big questions like ""what are the boundaries of time and space?"", ""what lies beyond the boundaries of our universe?"", ""why does everything decay?""  But the book doesn't give you an omnipotent view of what's happening. I felt as confused about the events as the characters in it.  Even the end left me feeling a little confused about what I just read. Ultimately, I believe the book is about the struggle between life and entropy.<br/><br/>However, don't let my confusion or description of its themes make you think this is some slow-moving and boring philosophy book disguised as a sci-fi novel.  There is plenty of action in this book, and it's of a very wild nature. There is a rather long chase in which Jesus of Nazareth is using a maser (that's right a maser, not a laser) to hunt Siddhartha (aka Buddha) who retaliates with mini-nuclear missiles (he has been ""reincarnated"" as a cyborg). There's something you don't read every day!<br/><br/>Overall, the book is a good, quick read, that will leave you thinking about big questions.",,,,,,0,,,,,

It's not just a cranky old academic complaining about style.  He really rips PowerPoint apart.  The in-depth analysis of the NASA incident is especially damning. PowerPoints were used in place of technical reports when they were assessing the damage to the Space Shuttle Columbia's wing.  Although the evidence did not truly suggest the shuttle would be fine, the takeaway from reading the PowerPoints was that everything would be OK.  Instead the shuttle overheated and blew up upon reentry. <br/><br/>This was especially interesting for me, having just recently finished ""Understanding Media"" by Marshall McLuhan. I could sense McLuhan's ideas underneath Tufte's text.  Tufte argues that PowerPoint is a marketer's tool for sales pitches, which are not intended to deliver true information.  They exist to manipulate the audience.  And that is what has become of our scientific, academic and professional meetings.  We do not deliver evidence with PowerPoint, we deliver a sales pitch.  The result is poor decision making.  I'd love to hear both authors thoughts about Twitter (if McLuhan was still alive).  This has certainly changed my perception of PowerPoint.",,,,,,0,,,,,

The authors put clear arguments forward that show how the physical coercion of territorial governments can control the Internet, with the great firewall of China as an extreme example. Governments can coerce ISPs, which in turn can filter and shape the Internet. They can coerce financial service providers, which can make or break an online vendor. And so on. But this is not such a bad thing, according to them. The authors point out how the mundane presence of government gives the Internet the stability it needs to thrive as a marketplace. Their argument is valid, but I cannot imagine it will convince the most radical of the Internet libertarians. Stability is only necessary for businesses looking to make a buck through the Internet. The hippie culture of the early Internet enthusiasts could care less about the fortunes of eBay, wsj.com, Yahoo!, or any other example the authors bring forward.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great read. It's fairly short, and manages to put forth a narrative style throughout much of it, which makes it that much more engaging.<br/><br/>The story about Jon Postel splitting the root of the Internet in the late 90's was particularly interesting. I'm don't know how I managed to earn my degree without learning about that before.",,,,,,0,,,,,

Why can't Congress solve any of our significant problems? Because the members of Congress are constantly pandering to the whims of their campaign contributors and not to the voters. They talk big during election cycles, but when it comes to legislating, all their ideals go out the window. This book does a very good job of describing dependency corruption and how it is different from quid pro quo corruption. Lessig makes an excellent argument about why this is the most important political issue. All of our other problems cannot be resolved with a broken system. We must fix the system first. He discusses the Citizen's United court case and how it effects the issue. And he gives four strategies for effecting change in the system.

I highly recommend it to anyone who loves science fiction or hates the dehumanizing structures of corporations. The book is an excellent modern example of the former and a clever, articulate invective against the latter.<br/><br/>Corporations have been on my mind a lot lately, mostly because of non-fiction books and lectures I have come across, as well as recent political debates. I found it delightful to read a work of fiction that pulls a lot of those threads together and presents the ideas in a new way with strings of words that haven't been used before. His taxonomy of ""pencilneck"" company men was particularly enjoyable.<br/><br/>The book is an examination of the multiple personas that people have and the way that corporations exploit them. The company man is expected to squash his most human traits and to become a cog in the machine, with no qualms about immoral or inhuman actions. Those that are unwilling or unable to switch off their humanity are replaced by those who can.<br/><br/>I am surprised that I had not heard of this book before. It was published four years ago. I only happened to find it at the library because the paperback has a very bright orange cover that called out to me to pick it up. This book is the perfect piece of science fiction for our times.

Lots of intriguing ideas, but presented with vague language and very little supporting evidence. Sometimes while reading it I was unsure if I was reading the profound thoughts of a genius that was above my comprehension, the ramblings of a mad man, or just the drivel of a hack who thought he was a lot more clever than he actually was.<br/><br/>The scholarship in this book is embarrassingly sloppy. At times he makes big claims with absolutely no evidence to support them. When he does offer evidence it is often anecdotal, with no reference to anything concrete. He'll write something like ""a study was conducted in Canada a few years back in which X happened,"" and then use that as solid proof that X is universal. Come one man! Where's the citation? You expect me to believe the outrageous claims you're making with no proof? I felt like I was reading cult literature at times. What's more, some of his claims, without a good understanding of the context, can be taken as quite racist.<br/><br/>I read one defense of his lack of evidence which argued that he came from the humanist tradition (he was an English professor) which does not rely on the scientific methods of hypothesis and experimentation, etc.  That's a terrible excuse. If you're going to start spouting off about cognitive science and social psychology you better bring some hard evidence to support your claims or no one will take you seriously.<br/><br/>I really want to give this book a higher rating, because some of his ideas are very interesting and sound plausible and I do think I have learned to look at media and world history in a new way. But I could not in good faith recommend this book to a friend unless they were hardcore about media studies. I could possibly forgive the lack of evidence and recommend it to someone with a caveat regarding such, but his terrible prose is perhaps an even bigger hurdle to get over than his credibility. He presents his ideas in metaphors, but, because of the nature of his topics, sometimes it's difficult to be sure if he is being literal or metaphorical. This may be cute to some, but it is embarrassingly bad for a scientific text. Furthermore, many of his theories are contradictory, which makes it even more difficult to understand or take seriously.<br/><br/>I wish someone would go through this book, pluck the interesting and plausible ideas from it and present them in a clear way that exposes the contradictions and areas that require more research for support, because there is a lot of good food for thought in the pages of this book. Unfortunately, I don't think those morsels are worth the effort of reading this book.",,,,,,0,,,,,

However, I do not think it will satisfy everyone who is considering reading it. I know many of my librarian colleagues and my classmates from the School of Information probably have this on their to-read lists. Many of them are probably more interested in contemporary issues of information management, such as information retrieval, social network analysis and human-computer interaction. This book touches some of those issues, and indeed many others, but this book is primarily about the history of information theory. The subtitle of the book is ""A History, A Theory, A Flood,"" but the Flood part is only discussed in the final chapters. The rest of it is devoted to the theory and history.<br/><br/>You can tell that Gleick has spent his career writing biographies and histories of physicists and mathematicians, because those subjects are covered in greater detail in this book. The two most prominent individuals that Gleick focuses upon are Charles Babbage and Claude Shannon. If you're interested in the history of science, math and philosophy, or if you would like a good explanation of information theory (which I think most people do not understand correctly) then I would recommend this book. Otherwise, this book may not be what you are hoping it to be.<br/><br/>If you are into that sort of thing, then this book will be a fun read for you. I found it extremely fascinating. <br/><br/>A couple passages that made me pause:<br/><br/>An amusing quip on entropy: ""Living things manage to remain unstable."" Indeed. Increased entropy is the natural progression of the universe. But living things maintain an organized state, which is highly anti-entropic. Hence, we are all unstable people!<br/><br/>On memes: ""...rhyme and rhythm help bits of text get remembered. Rhyme and rhythm are qualities that aid a meme's survival, just as strength and speed aid an animal's. Patterned language has an evolutionary advantage. Rhyme, rhythm, reason--for reason, too, is a form of pattern."" This is an interesting thought. Reason as simply a pattern--a memory aid. ",,,,,,0,,,,,

Due to medical reasons, I ended up dropping the course for which it was assigned. That was not a disappointing moment for me. Rather I saw it as a reprieve from further reading of this text, which I found very boring and loathed to pick up. It did not help that the professor was also pretty crummy.  He did nothing but read his slides (not very eloquently either). And about 80% of the content of the slides were taken directly from the book.<br/><br/>A lot of data mining texts cite this book, so I suppose there must be something good about it. The content is accurate and only slightly stale. But the presentation is very utilitarian. Reading this textbook feels the same as reading an operating manual for an old printer, which is sad, because the topic of data mining is very intriguing. <br/><br/>There are lots of data mining books on the market.

I am tempted to give it only three stars because, overall, the book feels a little half-baked. This is probably because it is not really a novel, but a novella (it's only 150 pages). The ideas presented in the story are intriguing, the plot and characters are well constructed, but the drama and the prose seem more like a Cliff's Notes version of the story rather than a finished product. It's not as moving as it could be. However, the simple prose and short length make it a very quick and easy read.

It took several months, but I finally finished. And this book was worth every minute. It's the best history of philosophy I've read. Not that I have read enough histories to determine that this is the best out there. But I have read a few which I can compare it to. Many histories of philosophy are far too simplistic, written at a level appropriate for a junior high student. I tried to break away from that type by reading Frederick Coppleston's history, but that was over-correcting the problem. Coppleston's history is very long (9 volumes at ~500pgs each) and far too dull for a casual reader. It is only suited for a dedicated student of philosophy. I got through the first volume and gave up.<br/><br/>Russell's history, however, is written perfectly for a casual reader with a college level education. His style is easy to read and even contains few bits of dry British humor. But aside from the prose, what really makes Russell's history superior is the manner in which he discusses each philosopher's theories. Russell explains the philosopher's biographical background and the major events of his time. He uses this contextual material to illustrate how external events influenced the thoughts of each philosopher. I think that is something that most histories of philosophy lack. And where the do include some context, it is usually a simple biography; they don't explain how certain events may have influenced modes of thought.<br/><br/>Another element that I very much enjoyed was Russell's own personality and opinions coming through in his critiques of past philosophers. For most of them, he maintains a commendable level of objectivity. But for those whose philosophies led to the foundations of Nazi fascism, you can sense his indignation. Russell was a Brit, and he wrote this history during WWII, so you might suspect there is something of a patriotic distrust of the German philosophers. But Russell was far from a nationalist either (he was thrown in jail for his pacifism during WWI). I think he disliked the German idealists (particularly Hegel and Nietzsche) because he was a humanist and liberal that could not tolerate any philosophy that could be used to promote the subjugation of one set of people by another.  <br/><br/>A couple items I thought were missing from this history were discussions of Wittgenstein and Godel. I can understand Russell's reluctance to discuss Wittgenstein. Russell was  Wittgenstein's teacher at Cambridge. And Godel's theorem essentially crushed Russell's life's work to create a complete and consistent logic, so I can also understand his reticence on that subject. But getting Russell's perspective on both of those men would have been extremely fascinating.<br/><br/>If you do decide to read this, I would highly, highly, highly recommend that you first read Logicomix, a graphic novel about several philosophers involved in the search for truth through logic. It focuses primarily on Russell, and through it you will gain an understanding about his personality, which will make reading his history of philosophy even more enjoyable. It will allow you to put Russell's words in a historical and biographical context, just as he does for the philosopher's that he critiques. And Logicomix is just a great read in it's own right.",,,,,,0,,,,,

However, the linguistic concepts in the book offer enough food-for-thought that, overall, I'm very glad I read this book and so I decided to give it four stars.<br/><br/>The book is an exploration of linguistic relativity, the theory that the language one speaks shapes the way one thinks. This idea has been around for a while, and for good reason: it is very intriguing. However, the strongest versions of the theory have mostly been debunked by linguists over the past fifty years, though the more mild versions of it have been shown to have some merit. Babel-17 is all about the strong version of the theory, and goes as far as to present a person that cannot grasp the concept of his own self because the language he speaks doesn't have the words ""I"" or ""you."" This is very far-fetched, and probably beyond what even Whorf, the theory's strongest proponent, would have imagined. Based on this, I was at first ready to criticize this book as being a bit lame, having carried the theory too far. But I thought about it some more and realized, ""Hey, this is science fiction. If I can suspend disbelief well enough to enjoy stories about aliens or time traveling, why can't I enjoy a story that explores the impossible reaches of linguistic theory?"" I see Babel-17 as a great example of a ""what-if"" story. What if language really did drastically bound ones ability to think? It's a fun idea to play with, and that's exactly what Delany has done in this story.",,,,,,0,,,,,

It took me that long to read it because I read it mostly in 10-15 minute chunks during my daily commute. Reading this book has been a pleasure throughout. The book has a surprisingly post-modern feel to it. Lots of stories within stories, self-reflexivity, etc. I particularly enjoyed vol 2, though vol 1 contains more of the iconic sequences, such as the battle with the windmills. <br/><br/>I really love the character of Sancho Panza. He steals the show, in my opinion. He is funny, endearing, and full of wisdom despite his outward foolishness. I found the most entertaining part of the story to be the section in which Sancho finally gets to be a governor and doles out justice in a more wise and efficient manner than most qualified officials.<br/><br/>Although this is the kind of book that I would wish to never end, I was very satisfied with the ending. For such a fun and silly story it has a very tragic ending. Don Quixote becomes ill, but through his physical illness he becomes clear headed and recognizes that he had been insane, and wasted his life romanticizing chivalric tales. He has no accomplishments to speak of, and no wife or children. This recognition of his wasted life destroys him and he soon dies. In a sense, he has lost his imagination, his childlike playfulness; he has matured, but because of his arrested development, his maturity is straight from childhood to death. Cervantes probably killed Don Quixote for fear of plagiarists that would steal his character, which had already happened between the publication of vols. 1 and 2. But the death of the Don also drives home his major point, his purpose for writing the book,  which was a warning against filling one's head with ridiculous, outdated ideals of chivalry.<br/><br/>Some things I would like to learn more about regarding this book:<br/><br/>What's with all the cross dressing? Several of the couched stories about lovers and prisoners contain elements of cross dressing. Is this part of Cervantes' commentary on gender roles or is it related to Don Quixote's own role-playing?<br/><br/>Did Cervantes predict the Romantic period of literature? Don Quixote is a tool for Cervantes to criticize the romanticizing of the chivalric literature of the past. However, the novel also contains a very large quantity of sub stories about shepherds, and Cervantes also criticizes the romanticizing of bucolic archetypes. In fact, after Don Quixote is defeated and must give up knight errantry, but before he regains his sanity, he proposes to become a love-sick shepherd instead. Much of the literature that would follow Cervantes 200 years later did indeed romanticize the pastoral life style. Did Cervantes see that coming and try to head it off, or was he only responding to an already strong pastoral sentiment among his contemporaries?",,,,,,0,,,,,
